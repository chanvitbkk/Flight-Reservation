## Flight Reservation :airplane:

## Fun fact :tada:

This is my first project and before this I haven't learn about web development

I want to apologise for this messy codes and file 

When I re-arrange a file. The webpage can not be open. :cry:

## How to use?
1. Open localhost (I'm using MAMP)
2. index.php is the home page
3. import flight.sql in PhpMyAdmin

## Note
1. connect.php file
- for macOS user: <br>
