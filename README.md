## Flight Reservation :airplane:

### Fun fact :tada:

This is my first web-based application project with a database. Before this, I haven't learned about web development.

I want to apologise for my messy codes and files in this project.


### How to use?
1. Open localhost (I'm using MAMP)
2. index.php is the home page
3. import flight.sql in PhpMyAdmin

### Note
1. connect.php file
- for macOS user: <br>
``` $mysqli = new mysqli('localhost','root','root','flight') ```
- for window user:<br>
``` $mysqli = new mysqli('localhost','','','flight') ```

2. Some PHP file has its CSS please check
